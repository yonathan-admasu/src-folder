                <p class="lc-paratext">rulings.law LLC (“<span class="lc-keyword">rulings.law</span>,” “<span class="lc-keyword">we</span>,” “<span class="lc-keyword">us</span>” or “<span class="lc-keyword">our</span>”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the rulings.law website where this Privacy Policy is posted (the “<span class="lc-keyword">Site</span>”) (we refer to the Site, the services and the software made available through the Site, collectively, as the “<span class="lc-keyword">Service</span>”).  As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Service how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and the Service.  By visiting the Site or using any of the Service, you consent to rulings.law’s collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.</p>

                <p class="lc-paratext">This policy answers the following questions:</p>

                <ul class="lc-list">
                  <li class="lc-listitem">What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</li>

                <h6 class="lc-subheading">Types of Information We Collect</h6>
                
                <p class="lc-paratext">Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you.</p>
                <p class="lc-paratext">We collect personal information when you participate in feedback forms, questionnaires, purchase a product through the Service, or receive customer or technical support.</p>
                <p class="lc-paratext">When you are purchasing products through the Service, you will be required to provide a billing address and credit card or other payment information. No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it.</p>
                
                <h6 class="lc-subheading">How We Use Your Personal Information</h6>

                <p class="lc-paratext">The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. If you choose to provide it to us, we may also use your email address as part of the Service in sending you messages about the Service and other general announcements.</p>
                <p class="lc-paratext">We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity with the Service. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Service. We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.</p>
                <p class="lc-paratext">We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Service.  We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.  This process is known as de-personalizing your information.</p>
                <p class="lc-paratext">Additionally, you grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Service (the “<span class="lc-keyword">Analytical Data</span>”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Service users.</p>

                <h6 class="lc-subheading">Do Not Track</h6>
                
                <p class="lc-paratext">In compliance with California legislation, AB370, effective January 1, 2014, rulings.law’s practices in responding to “do not track” signals and collecting user information over time and across a network of websites when you visit the Site are as follows: We do honor the request of “do not track” signals sent by your browser when you visit the Site. Additionally, rulings.law may collect user information about your online activities over time and across different websites and may authorize third parties to do so.</p>

                <h6 class="lc-subheading">Google Analytics</h6>
                
                <p class="lc-paratext">rulings.law uses Google Analytics to help us learn about who visits the Site and what pages are being viewed.</p>

                <h6 class="lc-subheading">Children’s Privacy</h6>

                <p class="lc-paratext">We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, or allow them to create an account for the Service. We take children’s privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times.</p>

                <h5 class="lc-heading">Will we share your personal information with third parties?</h5>

                <p class="lc-paratext">This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third-party websites linked to the Site. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information.  You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.</p>

Code Sections 1798.80, et seq.) provides California residents with the right to receive certain disclosures when personal information that has been collected online is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes.</p>
                <p class="lc-paratext">If you are a California resident and you provided personal information to the Site in the past, and/or if you do so in the future, you are entitled to submit a request in writing to rulings.law for a description of the information we may have provided to third parties.

                <p class="lc-paratext">We reserve our right not to respond to requests sent more than once in a calendar year. Please note that the California “Shine the Light” law does not cover all categories of information that may be collected and disclosed or shared, and our policy relates only to information covered by the law.</p>

                <p class="lc-paratext">If you are a resident of a country outside of the European Union, you also agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Privacy Policy that you and rulings.law will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties.  You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Los Angeles, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute.  Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.</p>

                <h6 class="lc-subheading">Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union</h6>
