Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”) and under the terms set forth in this ToU. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this <span class="lc-section">Section 18</span> and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this <span class="lc-section">Section 18</span> will control and prevail.</p>
                
                <p class="lc-paratext">Except as otherwise set forth in <span class="lc-section">Section 18.4</span>, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and rulings.law will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU, (a) you and rulings.law may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.</p>

                <p class="lc-paratext lc-level2list"><span class="number">17.2.</span><span class="heading">Location</span>. The arbitration will take place in Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone or internet connection appearances.</p>

                <p class="lc-paratext lc-level2list"><span class="number">17.3.</span><span class="heading">Limitations</span>. You and rulings.law agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between rulings.law and you individually. YOU AND RULINGS.LAW AGREE THAT (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (b) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (c) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</p>

                <p class="lc-paratext lc-level2list"><span class="number">17.4.</span><span class="heading">Exceptions to Arbitration</span>. You and rulings.law agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of rulings.law’s intellectual property rights; (b) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>

                <p class="lc-paratext lc-level2list"><span class="number">17.5.</span><span class="heading">Arbitration Fees</span>. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.</p>

If <span class="lc-section">Section 18.4</span> is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor rulings.law will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of <span class="lc-section">Section 18.4</span> found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you and rulings.law agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
